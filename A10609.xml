            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For by this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue dealing, all waſte wordes had bene pared away as excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſuperfluous to the body and ſtate of the question, and your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull demeanors againſt the proceedings &amp; ſuperioritie of Church-gouernors altogether ſpared. Which ſtratageme, as in the ſight of God and his Angels deteſtable and damnable, it hath rather with ſilence then with cenſure bene anſwered, and your wits exceedingly miſliked therefore: ſo this ſophiſme or manner of paralogiſme, if it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more mannerly, as dealing with materiall pointes, and letting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone perſonall, might deſerue leſſe reprehenſion or miſlike, whereunto I haue framed this briefe anſwere with Remonſtrance, ſhewing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie of your reaſons, fallacie of your ſyllogiſmes, indemonſtrable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, compiled by other in their bookes, combined vp in this booke of yours, worthied by you of this title, to be named a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to be ſurnamed a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the holy diſcipline of the Church, not the diſcipline of the holy Church, becauſe the Church is not ſo holy, but muſt be hallowed by the diſcipline. Whiles I am thus conuerſant in anſwering, I liſt not make of ten apparent digreſſion from the propoſitions which I anſwere, by inſtance to the contrarie, diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or deniall, and by returning or retorting all vpon your ſelues as I might, neither make a roadeouer to inuade other mens perſons with ſelaunder, as the <hi>Demonſtrator</hi> doth particularly, by producing at his
<pb facs="tcp:16243:3"/>pleaſure euery one into the <hi>Theatre</hi> of enuious diffamation: but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue a blanke or cyphre in Algoriſme, or an <hi>Abecedarie</hi> name. And doe farther pray, that all proteſtations of your zeale and godlines laied aſide, this Academicall lawe of diſputing ſchoolelike, being once enacted by your ſelues, may not be repealed: That whether your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrator hath more to ſay, he may ſtill ſyllogize, or if he haue ought to gaine-ſay, it may pleaſe him to distinguiſh, flatly denie, or giue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to an affirmatiue point. But if he haue no more to ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to fortifie his part, nor is able in this forme to diſpoſe of his ſayings; Let the wiſer ſort of your ſectaries ſuspend their iudgement, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crediting or admiring thoſe pitifull demonſtrations. All that I haue ſaid, is no more in ſubſtance, then that which hath bene afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. The ſolutions of your arguments are included in the anſweres to the Admonition, in the defenſe of that anſwere, in the anſwere to the Abſtract, in the defenſe of the diſcipline of the Church of England, and ſuch other learned workes, excepting ſome forced allegations annexed to the Demonſtration, and the coyned ſyllogiſmes. All which, by this method of Remonstrance is reanſwered, for it is but one anſwere. <hi>Omne verum, vero conſentaneum,</hi> Euery truth is but agreeeble to a trueth. <hi>Veritas eſt ſimplex, mendacium eſt multiplex,</hi> there is but one trueth. And although you multiply and vrge your falſhood, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide or ſubdiuide or part into infinite fractions, yet it is but one and the ſame obiection, one <hi>Proteus</hi> putting on diuerſe miſhapes, the argument ſometime clowded vnder an equinoction, or coloured with ambiguitie of termes, or vailed with inconſequencie or diſorderly dispoſition of moode and figure, or transpoſition of partes of the figure, or borrowing <hi>Ignorationem elenchi,</hi> Ignorance or vncunning, whether the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holde, <hi>Ad idem, ſecundum idem, &amp;c.</hi> respectiuely to this, and not to that, or by begging <hi>Petitionem principij,</hi> to conclude one and the ſame by the ſelfe ſame: Or to be beholding to the fallacte <hi>à non cauſa,</hi> by arguing from inſufficient cauſe vntrue effect, and ſuch other ſophistications to plaister vp your aſſertions with vntrueth: <hi>videlicet,</hi> as theſe and ſuch like: As when you argue from your Puritane <hi>Idaea</hi> of gouernment, out of the <hi>14. Rom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All lawfull things are of faith: all lawfull things of faith are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the worde, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all lawfull things are warranted by the worde, and conſequently euery lawfull action in gouernment of the Church: Where the concluſion is vniuerſall in the third figure, and
<pb facs="tcp:16243:4"/>
               <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> videlicet, (lawfull things) is in the concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all rule of reaſoning, and yet the Demonſtrator miſſeth of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> wordes which are, <hi>Quicquid non ex fide peccatum eſt.</hi> All that is not of faith is ſinne. Or where as you argue <hi>Hypotheticallie</hi> out of the <hi>4. Epheſ.</hi> If all needfull gifts be appropriate to other miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then is the Archbiſhops miniſterie vnlawfull, but they are, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Archbiſhops vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>And <hi>T. C.</hi> before you argueth <hi>Categorically</hi> after this ſort:</p>
            <p>Thoſe functions onely are ſufficient for the Church which haue gifts needfull: but all thoſe <hi>Epheſ. 4.</hi> and <hi>Cor. 1.12.</hi> haue gifts needfull, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are onely ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Which is as good a concluſion as if one of you did argue thus:</p>
            <p>Thoſe things onely are ſufficient to ſaluation which are contained in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But all thoſe things in the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> are contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> thoſe things onely in the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> are ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Or as cunningly after this ſort.</p>
            <p>Thoſe onely are men which are endued with reaſon.</p>
            <p>But all the Coſterdmongers in London are endued with reaſon, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Coſterdmongers in London are the onely men.</p>
            <p>Or where you goe about to prooue that none is ordinable to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, vnleſſe he haue a benefice.</p>
            <p>As was the <hi>12.</hi> place for <hi>Mathias,</hi> ſo is a certaine place for euery church officer.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mathias</hi> was not ordained till <hi>Iudas</hi> had made it voyd by han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> none is to be ordained before the place be voyd.</p>
            <p>Adde vnto this, by ſuch maner of Reſignation as hanging of himſelf: Or when another Apoſtleſhip falleth voide: Or when euery <hi>12.</hi> place is voyd: Or when <hi>Mathias</hi> commeth againe to be choſen into <hi>Iudas</hi> place.</p>
            <p>The Argument leapeth from one <hi>predicament</hi> to another, from the <hi>predicament Agere</hi> to <hi>Vbi:</hi> They ordained him to an office, <hi>Ergo,</hi> to a place, and a certaine place, as if the Apoſtles were not to preach <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Elie</hi> the prieſt ſate vpon a ſtoole by one of the poſtes of the Temple, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Miniſter must be reſident, and belike muſt alſo as he did ſit
<pb facs="tcp:16243:4"/>downe vpon a ſtoole. Or this: A Shepeheard muſt feede: a Minister is a Shepeheard, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he muſt corporally and continually reſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturall or legall diſpenſation for his abſence.</p>
            <p>As if you had ſayd a Miniſter to be a Shepeheard, otherwiſe then <hi>Metaphoricallie:</hi> for a king alſo is a ſhepeheard, but in a Metaphor, who may law fully depute others to gouerne and to feede.</p>
            <p>Or againſt <hi>non Reſidence</hi> out of the <hi>1.

Satan hindred me, that is, after the Demonſtrators skill, Satan cauſed me to doe an vngodly and vnlawfull thing, whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> his meaning is, Satan raiſed perſecution againſt me.</p>
            <p>Or as fitly and perfectly after this ſort for your popular elections and choiſe of miniſters from the <hi>8. Num. 9. v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> put their handes vpon the heads of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Leuites</hi> put their hands vpon the heads of bullocks: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people must lay their hands on the heads of the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Then adde vnto this: The Miniſters muſt lay their hands on the heads of bullocks. <hi>T. C.</hi> taught you to reaſon thus from the ceremonie to the Goſpell: <hi>Et vitulo tu dignus, &amp; hic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or when it pleaſeth you to eſtabliſh the presbyterie, you interprete roundly, <hi>Dic eccleſiae,</hi> tell the Church, that is, the Elderſhip or Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of the Church: yea and goe farther for the authoritie of this venerable Elderſhip, out of the <hi>49. Eſay,</hi> Kings and Queenes ſhall worſhip thee with their face towards the earth, and ſhall licke vp the duſt of thy feete, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> great homage and honour ſhall be done to the Elderſhip.</p>
            <p>Or in that place where you ouerthrow all ſtanding ſuperioritie of Miniſters ouer Miniſters, you demonſtrate after this faſhion.</p>
            <p>A biſhop is called <hi>Epiſcopus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An ordinarie Minister is called <hi>Epiſcopus: Ergo,</hi> all one.</p>
            <p>Or a Biſhop and an ordinarie Miniſter muſt haue one qualitie: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> a pariſh Biſhop and a diocoeſan Biſhop are all one thing. Or, all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are equall in commiſſion of the Miniſterie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> equal in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer commiſſion of authoritie. Or, In the beginning for a while a Biſhop and a prieſt or Miniſter were all one: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they muſt continue all one.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16243:5"/>
            <p>For in the Apoſtles time was the change, and that ſame, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Cephas,</hi> was the occaſion of the change: and finally the decree of all the world (at leaſt as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh) was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the change. This were ſtrange reaſoning: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Kings and prieſts were all one, <hi>ergo,</hi> they muſt continne all one. In the beginning ſuch was the ſimplicitie, &amp;c. Great lords ſonnes, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. kept their fathers ſheepe: <hi>ergo,</hi> noble mens children muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the Pope be odious, the Archbiſhop is odious alſo, as who would ſay: If the vnmeaſurable and illimitable power be vnlawfull, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a modeſt and limited ſuperioritie by law is vnlawfull alſo. <hi>Finiti ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum nulla eſt proportio.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhops office and name is vnknowen to vs Puritanes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> vnknowen and vnheard of in the Church.</p>
            <p>You ſhall well know that both the name and equitie of the name and thing is knowen and allowed of in Gods Church. Or, where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaieth there were gouernours of order, not of ſuperioritie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is true: as if it were truly ſayd, all gouernment of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is gouernment of diſorder, and that theſe were oppoſite. Or in the demonstration: To prooue Doctor and Paſtor to be distinguiſhed, you diſpute cunningly thus.</p>
            <p>Male and female are distinct in ſexe or kind, <hi>Gal. 3. Ergo</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Paſtor muſt be diſtinct: why not then in ſex or kind? with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other like <hi>Paralogiſmes,</hi> as in your ſeuerall Chapters ſhal be vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the whole Demonſtration being nothing els but a bundle of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. Howbeit, the booke thereof is a thing ſo preciouſly eſteemed by the author himſelf, ſo magnified by his folowers, as worthy to be ſet vpon the higheſt pinacle of this Church new reformed: for which cauſe hee giueth himſelfe ſuch applauſe for writing of it, &amp; glorifieth himſelfe as if he were riding vpon the <hi>Cherubins</hi> with Luciferian pride, or as if he were to draw downe as the Dragons taile all the ſtarres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſent of ſcriptures, Councils, Fathers old and new, onely to giue light to the cauſe in handling.</p>
            <p>And concerning other mens bookes that haue oppugned the cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:16243:5"/>he ſpeaketh ſcornefully and diſdainfully, as of the lord Archbiſhop and Deane of <hi>Sarum</hi> their bookes, whoſe learned trauailes, neither <hi>T. C. W. T. I. V.</hi> nor any eccleſiaſticall diſcipliner of them all, are able to confute, vnleſſe to raile in all their writings, and ſnatch at one word in <hi>40.</hi> leaues, bee to anſwere a booke: whoſe vertue notwithſtanding ſhall ſhine, when your canckred malice ſhall bee dead. Touching that moſt reuerend Prelate, you and your complices may in this licentious and outragious world ſpeake pleaſurablie: Neuer yet good man ſpake but honour of him, whom her Maieſtie hath graciouſly vouchſafed vnder her to exerciſe Chriſtian iuriſdiction and authoritie: whoſe Primacie is humilitie, who is for his vertue no leſſe honoured then loued, whoſe learning angreth you, vnto whom if you will make anſwere, you muſt ſtudie for more learning. I am verily perſwaded, that as God in all ages raiſed excellent men, inſtruments of his glorie to confute and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out of the Church hereſie, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the <hi>Arrians, Auguſtine</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts, Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in former times: In our latter times biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the falſe Catholikes and <hi>Semipelagians:</hi> ſo God hath ſtirred vp this learned man againſt the falſe brethren and <hi>Aerians</hi> of our time, to hammer and beate downe the ſchiſme and ſingularitie of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes. And therefore I doe humbly thanke God, that it hath pleaſed his glorious maieſtie in heauen, and her excellent maieſtie here on earth, to reſerue him to theſe times. I ſpeake it in the feare of God, had not her Maieſties principall ſpirite of wiſedome illumined with Gods trueth, together with the Heroicall prudent ſpirites of certaine hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonages and induſtrious learned men, affecting a prouident care of the poſteritie of the Church, patronized this Church-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, your priuate ſpirites of new-fangled diſcipline happily had more preuailed againſt theſe godly and religious proceedings in the Church, nay, to the vtter remoouing of the Goſpell by ſuch confuſion and <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</hi> Imagine that the externall face of that Church where you might ſee ſo many thouſand Superintendents, ſo many Elderſhips aduanced in or aboue the Church, to make orders and to cenſure at pleaſure, where the people giue voices, the Laitie lay on handes, the maieſtie of the Prince excluded from all ſwaie in the presbyterie: all antiquitie forlorne, all Councils vtterly repealed, doctrine deuided from exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Laie-men Deacons of the Church, pariſh biſhops, parrot prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the Vniuerſities diſgraced of the priuiledge of granting degrees,
<pb facs="tcp:16243:6"/>Cathedrall Churches by greedie wolues ſpoiled, all courtes of Iustice ouerthrowen or impaired by the Conſiſtoriall court of Elders, and as it were all the trees of the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> plucked vp, to implant <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucus</hi> the faire goodly Elders or Elder tree. Or els what may be the fantaſie or imaginarie forme of this reformation in matters of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall gouernment? They themſelues skill not: or when you haue ſupplanted or ouerturned, or turned out thoſe Eccleſiaſticall Senators and gouernours which we haue, whence ſhall the ſupplie bee of able go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours? from beyond the ſeas? that is impoſſibilitie. From your ſelues? that is matter of difficultie. From vs againe? that were egregious and ridiculous follie. Might it not fare with vs as it ſometimes did with the Commons of the Citie of <hi>Capua?</hi> the Commons bare a deadly hate to the magiſtrates and gouernours of the Citie. Vpon a time the councell of the Citie being in conſultation of their affaires, one <hi>Pacunius</hi> (as <hi>Liuie</hi> writeth) <hi>Homo vſus malis artibus,</hi> he was not the best man, maketh an inſurrection with the Commons, and ſuddenly ſhutteth all the Magiſtrates into one place, and with ſufficient garriſon keepeth the place, and held them all as priſoners within, giueth farther this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to the Commons to draw them foorth one by one, and to put euery one to death, and to put others in their places, to create new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gouernours of the Citie. This aduiſe pleaſed them well. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth in order the firſt to be drawen foorth to execution, as a man woorthie of death: euery baſe and tumultuarie varlet crieth out, he is woorthie of an hundred deaths, let him bee ſhortened by the ſhoulders. The noble <hi>Senator</hi> whiles he is to lay downe his necke vpon the blocke, <hi>Pacuuius</hi> (as chiefe ſpeaker) pawſeth on the matter: Sirs, before wee put this man to death, it were good we did nominate another to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie his place: this noble Citie may not ſtand without a Senate. That counſell alſo ſeemeth pleaſing vnto them, they ſtreight proceed on to the nomination and election of a <hi>Senatour,</hi> One man nameth one, that man nameth another, each man as he best fanſieth, maketh a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nomination: no ſooner any man is named, but a <hi>1000.</hi> exceptions are taken to the partie, the perſon named is thought vnwoorthy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for baſeneſſe of his parentage, or vileneſſe of his trade, or meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his fortunes, or lacke of this, or lacke of that: the ſedition thereupon is diſſolued of it ſelfe, the election of a new ſet of officers is interrupted, euery one plainly ſeeth his owne follie and temeritie. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blablie if like power were giuen, as in the Preface of your Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>This is the maine concluſion of theſe monſtrous Demonſtrations,<note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.</note> not to be worthied the name of Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, foraſmuch as I haue learned,

               <p>In this concluſion, if by <hi>gouerning,</hi> were vnderſtoode the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in faith and manners of euery true member of the Church, it were ſimply to be granted. But theſe men (as by their whole diſcourſes appeareth) vnderſtand thereby the gouernment for the externall pollicie and orders of the whole Church in generall, alſo of euery greater part thereof (as the Church of an whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prouince) and of euery ſeuerall congregation.</p>

               <p>If therefore by theſe wordes <hi>(deſcribeth perfectly)</hi> he and they meane that all the whole frame and forme of this gouernment, and the officers to execute the ſame, with their names, adiuncts, offices, and ſeuerall authorities particularly and ſpecifically are either expreſſed, or by the word of God immediatly and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily may be concluded: both we denie it, and themſelues nowe at length (though with much a doe) confeſſe it not to be true.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>T.

And to this very purpoſe ſerue all the arguments of this firſt Chapter: Inſomuch as <hi>Barrowe</hi> (who profeſſeth that he holdeth nothing, which he hath not gathered out of thoſe, and like mens bookes) ſtill thinketh, that none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal orders or lawes at al are lawful now to be ſet down for the Church, becauſe Chriſt hath ſet downe ſufficient in particular.</p>
               <p>But the other ſorte ſomewhat wiſer, being taught by their ſchoole-miſtreſſe experience, that vpon triall made euery expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient particular in external gouernment could not be ſo proued, haue by their Champion <hi>Martine the Malepart,</hi>

               <p>And the whole fraternitie (as I heare) either in perſon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatiuely, being out of all coaſtes of this land <hi>ſynodically</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, haue nowe impounded <hi>The holy diſcipline</hi> (which they holde to be deſcribed in the worde, to be <hi>eſſentiall, eternall,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable</hi>) vnto the fourth part of one ſheete of paper: but their <hi>Synodicall diſcipline</hi> (which already vpon the firſt licking is ſeuen times as great as the other,) they thinke in ſome reſpects to be <hi>neceſſarie</hi> and <hi>eternall,</hi> in other reſpects to be <hi>mutable:</hi> but howe much of it lookes the one way, and howe much the other way, they haue not yet reueiled.

               <p>Yet here of by the way we gather, that ſuch as breake foorth from the Biſhops gouernment and cenſures (as our ſchiſmatikes doe with greateſt contempt that may be) doe offend againſt the commandements and the doctrine or diſcipline of the Goſpell: and therefore a ſuperioritie of Biſhops is a diuine inſtitution, by <hi>Cyprians</hi> iudgement, who liued not very long after the Apoſtles times.</p>

               <p>This is a moſt lewd affirmation in the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops office is needleſſe, becauſe the miniſterie is perfect without it. The Demonſtrator is as bold as any man, and as blind as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: but boldneſſe and blindneſſe are the two helpes. As for the reaſon that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie is perfect without it, it is an vnperfect reaſon: For as iuſtly may he ſay the office of a Chriſtian King is needleſſe in the church, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie is perfect without it. This is a doubtfull clauſe to leaue the miniſterie in ſpeculation, not in action: or to conſider of the being of the miniſterie, not of the well being of the ſame. Let this one word ſerue for your anſwer, if you will be anſwered.

               <p>The office of Church-Aldermen ouer all men, and all maners, is needeleſſe in our Church, where a Chriſtian magiſtracie is eſtabliſhed alreadie, and becauſe no place of Scripture affirmeth for it, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is vnlawfull in the Church, and none but <hi>T.C. ideſt,</hi> thankleſſe curioſitie would bring it in place. Or this.</p>
               <p>That which is needleſſe, is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>All courtes of Record, as Chancerie and Common pleass, &amp;c. ſhall be found needleſſe if the Conſiſtorie of Presbyters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſet vp, which is onely needfull, or elſe full of neede, in the Church or congregation of the faithfull brethren, becauſe

               <p>Thus then we reaſon out of their owne grounds.</p>
               <p>What office ſoeuer is needleſſe, <hi>ideſt,</hi> is not neceſſarilie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Church, the ſame is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian princes ſupreme gouernment in cauſes eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall (if wee beleeue theſe men) is needleſſe: for the learned diſcourſer (who ſaieth the Church was moſt flouriſhing when there was no Chriſtian magiſtrate) &amp; <hi>T.C.</hi> ſaith no leſſe, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no difference betweene an heathen and a Chriſtian king touching the matter of intermedling in church gouernment, ium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping therein with <hi>Harding</hi> and other papiſts: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (by this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the princes ſupreme gouernment is vnlawfull: which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and rebellious concluſion very neceſſarily followeth, not only of this aſſertion, but of infinite other their ſpeeches. Or thus.</p>
               <p>The office which is needleſſe, is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The hauing of an Elderſhip in euery congregation, is needles, for one <hi>Elderſhip</hi> in the towne ſerueth for the whole country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Geneua,</hi> where neuertheleſſe they haue diuers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their ſeuerall miniſters.

But whatſoeuer <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, we ſay this to you: Biſhops in reſpect they are biſhops in England, haue no ciuill iuriſdiction: for the diſtinction of ciuill and eccleſiaſticall matters, is more priciſelie and vpon greater penalties here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then elſe-where in all Chriſtendome. If it bee ſaid ſome matters they handle bee ciuill, that are called eccleſiaſticall, wee aske whether oeconomicall matters bee not a part of ciuill, wherein they are as husbandly, nay niggardly as any: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demaund a rule out of Gods word (of them that vrge this as a ſinne) whereby to know a ſpecificall difference betweene ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. They cannot ſay becauſe ſome of thoſe which <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> courtes here handle, bee accounted elſe-where ciuill, therefore they may not be here Eccleſiaſticall: for of the contrary, ſome matters here mere ciuill, are elſe-where holden Eccleſiaſticall. As for example in <hi>Geneua</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> they inflict cenſures on thoſe which for ciuill enormious crimes the magiſtrat hath puniſhed or pardoned, as felons, manſlears, &amp; ſuch like, and all their <hi>preſbyteries</hi> (euen that among the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at <hi>Middleborough</hi>) vſe to deale with qualifiyng of forfeitures of bonds and accounts betweene hard maſters and their prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other ſuch <hi>Chancerie</hi> matters: much more therefore thoſe may iuſtly be accounted eccleſiaſtical, which the law &amp; ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate do put ouer to eccleſiaſtical me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which being in truth mere ciuil, are intruded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the presbyteries.

As for teſtamentary cauſes, euen at the common law of this land, they haue bene alwaies made Eccleſiaſticall, both becauſe that lawe hath litle direction in thoſe cauſes (but ſuch as is borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ciuill and Eccleſiaſtical lawes) and for that mens laſt wils (at leaſt were wont) do conteine ſundrie demiſes for Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, orphanes, poore, captiues, and ſuch like good vſes, whereof the Church had the fourth part, and wherein Biſhops are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be moſt carefull to miniſter right indifferently to all, for performance of the deads will.</p>
               <p>Any iuriſdiction ciuill, which Biſhops, or ſome Eccleſiaſticall perſons haue, is not claimed by them as due to their functions, but impoſed by the Prince, as vpon ſubiects ſeruiceable for the Realme, and for a credite to their places, as Counſeller, Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Iuſtice of the Peace, &amp;c. For ſeeing they are ſubiects, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and citizens of the Common-wealth, (beſides their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Church) I would knowe whether they owe not this dutie, (being impoſed on them,) vnto the Common-wealth, and their Prince? But we ſhall not (I truſt) neede to perſwade much with theſe men, for they are not ſo ſquemiſh of ciuill honor and function, as they would then ſeeme, whiles their malignant eies are onely faſtened vpon Biſhops.

               <p>If none ought to bee called a ſhepheard that hath no flocke of ſheepe to keepe,<note place="margin">Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> nor watchman which is not allotted to a place to watch: then none may be ordeyned to any office before the place be voyd: the 1. is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>I denie the antecedent and ſequel of the ſame:<note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.</note> for a man may be called a ſhepheard and haue neuer a flocke of ſheepe of his owne or others to keepe: as many poore men who are expert in the knowledge and are not worth a ſheepe, or as <hi>Iacob</hi> he and his fathers were ſhepheards, &amp; accounted themſelues ſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Pharao,</hi> for that was their trade. Or a man may bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a captaine, if he haue inſtruction of military diſcipline, though he doe not euer leade a bande of ſouldiers: denomination is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the habit then of the acte. If a ſhoomaker haue ſold all his ſhoes, or a graſier all his cattell, belike their trades and names are cleane gone. Now farther to ſay, that none may be called to the promotion of a ſhepheard, vnleſſe forthwith ſome man deliuer him a flocke of certaine ſheepe, it is a pretie imagination, as if he could be his craftsmaſter before his craftsman.</p>
               <p>But to the ſequel of the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to argue hee cannot bee made a ſhepheard before a place bee voyde, <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee cannot be made a miniſter before the place be voyde. This is eaſily auoyded: For no man is ſo made a miniſter for a particular pariſh or ſmall precinct of place, as that his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were gone, if the pariſh were diſpeopled and the houſes burnt vp, but hee is made a miniſter for the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande wherſoeuer his ſeruice ſhall be required in the prouince or place. This is an olde ſtoppegamball.</p>
               <p>No more coates then backes to weare them.</p>
               <p>No more miniſters then places to diſpoſe them.</p>
               <p>The miniſterie ſhalbe like to a drawebridge: keepe them ſure
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16243:36"/>enough that are within, keepe them ſecure enough from dealing in the miniſterie, who albeit of their pure zeale (as many with vs which would preache the goſpel,) becauſe of lacke of roome, ſhalbe faine to ſtand without.</p>

               <p>One ſhepheard muſt haue one flocke by their delineation, or many ſhepheards may not haue one flock for feare of thronging or intruſion: which otherwhiles they admit of the puritane tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: <hi>vnum ad vnum est aptiſſimum,</hi> one is fitteſt for one: It is in very deede the beſt referencie: for one thing <hi>ſecundùm idem</hi> cannot haue ſundrie relation.</p>

For neither in the Apoſtles times, nor any times after (that I can reade of) is there pregnant proofe to be found, that for the choiſe and ordination <hi>preſbyteri alicuius,</hi> of any prieſt or paſtorall elder onely (for there were no Lay elders heard of) any moe then one biſhop was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In deede when a biſhop was to be choſen, it is often to be founde in the Primitiue Church, that the prieſtes or paſtorall el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which for moſt part then liued in the great cities, where bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sees were planted, (though according as the biſhops thought good they were ſent out into the territorie a dioyning, to preach, baptize, and miniſter the ſupper) being with the people aſſembled, and often with the Metropolitane, and ſome other biſhops direction, did nominate whome they thought good to haue choſen for their biſhop, whome if the people liked, they would crie, <hi>Dignus eſt, iustus est,</hi> he is well worthie, he is a iuſt man. If they liked him not who was named, they would with great clamours, yea often times with outrages of blowes and murther, importune them to another nomination. So that there was no ſcrutinie of ſuffrages of the people, as hauing intereſt, but a tumultuarie proceeding, and acclamation or exclamation of the multitude preſent at ſuch actions. Therefore the olde Canons ſpeaking hereof, doe vſe for the moſt part, but the wordes <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monij ciuium, &amp; conſcientiae populi,</hi> of teſtimonie of Citizens, and knowledge of the people, with which theſe elections of biſhops onely were made: but becauſe they breede great tumults, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and murders (as the ancient Fathers, and hiſtories of the Church teſtifie) they were abrogated both by counſell and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſtian Emperours (vpon whome by lawe the people in al matters had beſtowed their whole right) ſince which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16243:43"/>time the prieſts of ſeuerall Sees in the name of the reſt (which we cal now the Chapters of Cathedral Churches) haue had the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their biſhops, being (if the Emperour or prince thought good) directed to ſome one ſpeciall man by his nomination.</p>
               <p>In England according to the auncient common law of the land, the prince granteth leaue to the Chapter to elect a biſhop to the void See, which licence is called <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> and withall ſendeth letters to them, nominating him whom her maieſtie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on graue aduiſe of her honourable counſell, iudgeth fit, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their choiſe of him. The election being made, ſhe giueth her roiall aſſent vnto it, requiring the Archbiſhop to confirme the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection if it be dulie &amp; canonically made, &amp; after with two other biſhops, to conſecrate the elect: the day and place for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, is publiſhed a competent time afore, that if anie thinke good to propound againſt the perſon of the man or forme of election, they may be heard. After this confirmation, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the conſecration according to the preſcription of the booke: then is the biſhop to doe his homage perſonallie to her maieſtie for his temporall reuenues, and after to haue them reſtored vnto him. Now to the temporalties of a biſhoprike, a Baronrie by law is annexed, whereby he is a lord of the parliament.</p>
               <p>Other miniſters in the dioeceſſe are to be examined, approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ordained by the biſhop, hee and ſuch other miniſters as be preſent at the ordination, laying their hands vpon them. And when any is preſented to a ſet place or benefice by the patrone thereof, the biſhop is to examine his life and learning, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute him in title thereunto after hee haue approoued of him. This courſe of placing in the title of certaine roumes or benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces grew by theſe degrees and meanes, which will not be amiſſe alſo to point at, becauſe many that will needs be medling, either know it not, or are wilfullie ignorant.</p>
               <p>At firſt (as was ſhewed afore) the biſhop and all his clergie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a kind of communitie in the citie, wherof he bare the name of biſhop, he and they going abroad at certaine moſt conuenient times to preach and miniſter the Sacraments in the territorie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioining: at what time all Church reuenues of the whole dioeceſſe, whether landes, tithes, oblations or legacies, were in common amongſt them, but at the diſtribution of the biſhop. One fourth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16243:44"/>part whereof was emploied <hi>pro menſa epiſcopali,</hi> for the B. hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie: another to maintaine thoſe of the Clergie: the third, for building and repairing the churches of the citie, &amp; reſt of the dioe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: the fourth, for redemption of captiues, for the poore &amp; for other godly vſes.</p>
               <p>But when ſundry perſons, partly vpon deuotion, and partly the rather induced to haue the nominating of a Miniſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, had built and endued diuers Churches in places farre diſtant in the countrey abroad, ſo that ſo many ſeuerall pariſhes could not conueniently nor ſo often be reſpected by thoſe who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwaies about the Biſhop (ſauing at certaine ſet times) and that the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie began through multitude of the clergy (being for the moſt part in one place) and ſundry other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to bee ouer-troubleſome and alſo enuious: then in moſt parts of the chriſtian world, they grew to a diuiſion of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church reuenues, ſo that the biſhop, the clergie that was to remain in the cathedrall church of the chiefe citie, and the clergie of the reſt of the dioeceſſe, had euery of them their ſeuerall portions allotted, as was thought expedient. Out of which, euerie of them ſeuerallie beſides their owne maintenance, was afterward to defray for the reparation of the fabrikes that were to be vpholden by them, &amp; to relieue the poore, &amp;c. as their ſeuerall abilities ſhould ſerue. In ſo much as the biſhop, who firſt was as a common paſt our of the whole dioeces, as the common law alſo at this day doth account him, and had afore (towards the vſes aforeſaid) the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues of the Church in title as a kind of proprietarie himſelfe, did then at the preſentation of the founders or Patrons, to whom the Canons gaue that preheminence (in regard of their coſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed) call other miniſters <hi>in partem ſollicitudinis,</hi> into a part of the charge, and by inſtitution of them vnto ſeuerall churches and the reuenues thereof, did as it were inueſt them to the title of that part of Glebe, tithes, &amp;c. which was accounted as his own afore, but vnto the ſaid vſes, which courſe now hath continued many hundred yeeres downe vnto theſe times.</p>

               <p>That which appertaineth vnto all,<note place="margin">Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> muſt be approued of all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the miniſterie in the Church pertaineth to all, <hi>ergo,</hi> auctoritie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue pertaineth to all.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>paralogiſme:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.</note> for <hi>auctoritie,</hi> is in the concluſion, which is not in either the premiſſes, and therefore 4. <hi>termini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Maior</hi> is a rule of lawe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quod omnium intereſt, ab omnibus debet approbari,</hi> but ſo many exceptions as ſyllables in the rule. But to the reaſon of the <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime</hi> or rule.</p>
               <p>Not euery one whome it concerneth to be gouerned, muſt haue a ſtroke in the choiſe of the gouernour, whether in election of a Maior of a citie, or choſing a Burgeſſe, or Knight of the ſhire, but <hi>legales homines,</hi> ſuch as are credited with the matter. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is too popular. To haue a good Prince is euery mans benefit, yet muſt not all Princes goe by election: and if this be a diuine rule of nature, and ſo to be vnderſtood, why doe the moſt voices carry the matter, yea the odde voice oftentimes?</p>
               <p>This abſurditie of demonſtrating is not out of kenning, but in euery mans ſight, if you would make another ſyllogiſme, which is this:</p>
               <p>That which pertaineth vnto all,<note place="margin">Retortion.</note> muſt be approoued of all:</p>
               <p>The miniſterie pertaineth to all men, women, and children of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16243:48"/>the Congregation, <hi>ergo,</hi> the approbation pertaineth to all men, women, and children of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>And if one do but diſſent, the election muſt be daſhed, becauſe all are intereſſed, and ſome one or other may be preiudiced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called thereunto, which is wholy contrarie to their practiſe and platforme: and though the miniſterie reacheth to all, doeth it therefore follow the election of the Miniſter doth belong to all? Why not then his vocation, examination, and his ordination by impoſition of handes as well ſhall belong to all? all which you doe alonely attribute to your Elderſhips.</p>

               <p>That which is moſt effectuall to bring the people to obedience,<note place="margin">Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is the beſt election, and may not be abridged: But election by common conſent is ſo, <hi>ergo,</hi> election by the Church is beſt, and all other vnlawfull.</p>

               <p>But election by common conſent is neither ſo nor ſo, if you meane the common and baſer ſorte of people taken into electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: nay the contrarie is true, for who hath choſen them may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them: which taketh away all godly libertie of franke rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, from the Miniſter, and in them all behoouefull awe and reuerence towards their owne creature.</p>
               <p>But ſir, if you can frame ſuch election that all the world can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vpon: <hi>Conſenſio nationum, lex naturae putanda eſt.</hi> The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all is the lawe of nature: otherwiſe in popular elections you perhaps knowe what <hi>Liuie</hi> in his firſt <hi>Decad,</hi> ſaith: <hi>vt ferè fit maior pars vincit meliorem,</hi> the greater part ouercommeth the better: but you runne not in your concluſion, becauſe though it were admitted to be beſt, yet doth it not followe that all other be vnlawfull and naught.</p>

               <p>This interpretation is but a newe tricke of one of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, in his Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline neuer heard of afore, and is conuinced by the pregnant circumſtances of the place, and the vniforme conſent of all ancient writers thereupon. For the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is directed to <hi>Timothie</hi> himſelfe, to the end to teach him how to demeane himſelfe in the Church. Immediatly afore this place, he giues precepts how widowes ſhould be maintained, and what proportion of allowance he was to make vnto miniſters: howe <hi>Timothie</hi> ſhould receaue an accuſation againſt a miniſter, what courſe he ſhould vſe in admonitions and rebukes, according to the diuerſitie of ſinnes. Then <hi>Paul</hi> adiureth him moſt earneſtly, that in the exerciſe of his office in this behalfe, he obſerue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall courſe of iuſtice, <gap reason="foreign">

Then followeth (after <hi>iuriſdiction</hi>) this precept of <hi>ordination,</hi> wherein he ought not to deale raſhly, leſt otherwiſe his ſinnes whome he ſo ordeineth, be imputed vnto him the ordeiner. And after a litle, anſwereth an obiection that might be made, howe it ſhoulde bee poſſible for him to knowe afore hande other mens ſinnes, that in this behalfe he might keepe him ſelfe blameleſſe. Therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> to take this away, ſaith: That his meaning is not of ſinnes that ſuch ſhall commit afterward, but of ſuch as were committed afore, which could no more be hidden, then a mans good conuerſation by paſt could be: ſo that by the whole courſe appeareth, that the other mens ſinnes, whereof in <hi>ordinations</hi> he is willed to beware, <hi>lest he communicate with them,</hi> and be made guiltie of them, are the ſinnes of him, that is to haue impoſition of handes, and not any elderſhip ſinnes, by reaſon of their raſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deining of others, which theſe men had rather make Elders very prone vnto, and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo leſſe carefull of all them then of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> alone, then that they ſhould not here by in ſome apparance, be ſhowldered into this action. Why man, if we ſhould not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe

Things that Chriſt commaunded to the Apoſtles, were of two ſortes: either things for knowledge, or for conuerſation, what was to be embraced, and what eſchewed. For matter of knowledge it was ſo eminent in the Apoſtles, being ledde by Gods ſpirite
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16243:57"/>vnto all trueth, as that they could not erre in their doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the Churches, and that the 72. Euangeliſts or any ſince, were not indued with like meaſure of it. <hi>Augustine, Hierome,</hi> with all the olde fathers and learned biſhops that haue written, haue both erred (and therefore were not able to teach all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt had commanded his Apoſtles to know) and in ſundrie points of Scripture confeſſe their ignorance. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Caluine</hi> (whoſe examples I vſe becauſe you doe moſt account of them) doe differ in ſundrie interpretations. By this rule then, the one of them (light on whether it will) was not able to teach all that Chriſt commaunded and commended to his Apoſtles, and conſequently no miniſter, becauſe none <hi>omniſcient</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>They doubt of ſome places, and ſome <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he vnderſtandeth not, as that in the <hi>Corinthians, Propter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos,</hi> and I know other places, which I perſwade my ſelfe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he vnderſtood not, at leaſt not aright: and ſhall not he be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with you an able miniſter? Then woe be to your ſelues of the faction that are of this opinion, for you will (I hope) giue place to <hi>Beza</hi> for ſufficiencie in learning. But eſpecially woe to them that neuertheleſſe thinke you miniſters, and receiue (as they thinke) ſacraments at your hands, yet in trueth nothing, if wee might beleeue your owne doctrines.</p>
               <p>The errour hereof riſeth, becauſe the Demonſtrator (folowing the ſteps of the deuill when hee tempted Chriſt) alleageth this Scripture defectiuelie.<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> For it is not, <hi>teaching them all that I haue commaunded you:</hi> but <hi>teaching them to obſerue all that I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded you.</hi> What? that all nations ſhould <hi>obſerue</hi> all that Chriſt <hi>commaunded the Apoſtles,</hi> either to know or to put in practiſe? no but teach them to <hi>obſerue</hi> what Chriſt commaunded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to haue obſerued: for the Apoſtles were to vſe many things as Apoſtles, which are not requiſite of euery Chriſtian to bee obſerued and kept. And as the Apoſtles knew many hid myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and depthes of knowledge which is not neceſſarie for euery miniſter to the being of his miniſterie in that hie meaſure to know: and as it is not neceſſarie to the being of euery Chriſtian, to haue as manie and as excellent degrees of knowledge, as any biſhop or miniſter of the worde (elſe were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16243:57"/>teacher and ſcholer:) ſo I doubt not but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were not indued with knowledge and other gifts all alike: and therefore that the like inequalitie may bee of miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, and amongſt common Chriſtians in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon one of another, without derogating hereby from them, the eſſence and being either of an Apoſtle, miniſter, or good chriſtian. The diuerſitie of giftes are in all ſortes of men of great multiplicitie and varietie, and euery one hath not all, but as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to diſpenſe.

               <p>The Argument holdeth good:<note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, with reply.</note> 
                  <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> did ordeine Elders, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Elders did not ordeine one another. As for the pieuiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: <hi>They did ordeine,</hi> that is, chiefly ordeine, as <hi>Ioſua,</hi> it is expreſly in the Text, That the Lord bidde <hi>Ioſua</hi> make ſharpe kniues and circumciſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by diuine Oeconomie he might do it: or in the 8. ver. is a clearer conſtruction, when they had made an ende of circumciſing, the Leuites did circumciſe: and <hi>Ioſua</hi> commanded, but nothing is in the Text that after <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had ordeyned, the others made an ende of the action, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16243:66"/>therefore were no parties in the beginning, middle or end of the ſame: for they commended them to the grace of God: ſo your ſimilitude or exemplifying in neither of theſe doth holde.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16243:70"/>which by that occaſion he deliuered. If both the ſtories be to be vnderſtood of one action, then muſt we interprete, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of all the Apoſtles (<hi>who of them ſhould be the greateſt</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Luke) had his original occaſion of the requeſt of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> children, at which the other Apoſtles tooke indignation, as <hi>Mathew</hi> teſtifieth: both they and all the Apoſtles dreamed of an earthly kingdom of Chriſtes: and therefore <hi>to ſit at his right hand, and at his left, and to be the greateſt,</hi> was an honour and ciuil prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and authoritie next vnto Chriſt in ſuch his kingdome that they ſhot at. He reprooued therefore this erroneous conceit, and for thinking that ciuil iuriſdiction ſhould appertaine to them as they were apoſtles, and drew them to another conſideration of his heauenly kingdome. If they deſired that to be giuen them to haue the very condition &amp; ſtate of their perſons ſo aduanced with earthly honor &amp; authoritie ciuil (in regard of ſome ſpeciall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuerally ſuppoſed Chriſt did beare vnto him) in this reſpect was it their ambition y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was reprooued.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the brawle &amp; contention that all the apoſtles burſt foorth into about this matter, was by our Sauiour taxed and blamed. Now the BB. in this church of England do not claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ciuil iuriſdiction or authoritie to be incident to their callings, although (if as citizens of the common weale &amp; ſubiects) ſome ſuch be impoſed vpon them by the prince, as they may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe, ſo (we know) they may lawdablie vſe it.

In that by the law and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the land, they haue the title of <hi>lordes,</hi> this is not <gap reason="foreign">

Neither was it forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo to euerie one of them ſeuerallie, as if it might haue bene permitted to them all together, or to the greater part of them: <hi>Quia nihil eſt in compoſito quod non eſt in ſimplicibus, vel actu vel ſaltem habitudine:</hi> If no one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might exerciſe ſuch rule nor any part of it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot they altogether haue it: neither yet was the prohibition perſonall to them, for then it would follow that albeit no one of them might haue authoritie ouer the reſt, yet their ſucceſſours neuertheleſſe (whether more properly taken as biſhops, or generally as all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word) might haue had ſuch authoritie as is there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, which were abſurd to imagine: ſo that the prohibition reacheth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, &amp; to euery one of them, &amp; to their ſucceſſours alſo. The whole difficultie therfore now reſteth in this, what kind of authoritie or rule either eccleſiaſtical or ciuil it is, which vnder the words <gap reason="foreign">

As for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>mind, they make not ſpecial difference of offices in the Church.

Nay they make them mutable vpon occaſions, and therefore not commanded by Scripture, which nowe in your laſt platforme you diſtinguiſh to be vnderſtoode not of the holy diſcipline which you ſay is <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,</hi> but of the <hi>Synodicall,</hi> belike neither holy, nor <hi>Eſſentiall:</hi> and yet this moueable part containeth theſe Chapters or heades: Of the neceſſitie of vocation, the maner of vocation and bounds of it, of election, of the maner of exerciſing a mans vocation, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Miniſters, and of the maner of the Liturgie, of making Sermons to the Church, of Catechiſme, of other partes of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, of Sacraments, of Baptiſme, of the Supper, of faſtes, of holy dayes, of Mariages, of Scholes, of ſtudents in Diuinitie and their exerciſes, of Elders, of Elderſhips, of Cenſures, of Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, of Claſſes or conferences, of Synods, with the iudgement touching all the Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>If the warrant both to haue a gouernment, and to execute it,<note place="margin">Abſurditie of the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator.</note> be deriued from the commiſſion of the prince, doeth it followe that all particular directions that may happen to be needefull about the execution of it, are there alſo ſet downe? But this ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons weigh not how their ſpeaches agree, either with their owne wordes, with their practiſe, with reaſon, or with trueth, ſo they may make a vaine ſhewe of ſome appearance to their ſimple fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers that are not able to iudge.</p>
               <p>I doe not thinke this man can be angrie with the letter of the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe, but with the <hi>Canoniſts, Sacerdotes iuris,</hi> the Prieſtes and interpreters of the Lawe, who haue inflicted vpon him ſome cenſure of the Lawe. I knowe not what the quarrell is, but this I am ſure, he doeth driue out by curſſe of the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> the whole courſe of the Lawe: Me thinke all his fight is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitharum pugnae,</hi> diſorderly fight.</p>

               <p>This is ſtrange doctrine, there muſt be no lawe in particular in the Church, but the Miniſter muſt at firſt teach. This is a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diuinitie and law. If the meaning be that by nothing it muſt be gouerned, but what the Miniſter muſt teach (as it muſt needes be, for elſe he ſaith nothing:) Then is the <hi>Maior</hi> falſe, &amp; the whole Syllogiſme more falſe, as conſiſting al of meere <hi>negatiues,</hi> for <hi>only</hi> is an implied <hi>negatiue,</hi> as <hi>onely man is reaſonable,</hi> is as much as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is reaſonable beſides man: and then it ſtandeth thus, By nothing muſt the Church be gouerned but what the Miniſter muſt teach: The Miniſters may teache nothing but the worde, <hi>Ergo</hi> by nothing but the worde muſt the Church be gouerned. If the Syllogiſme were good, the vntrueth of ſome part of it might thus appeare: By nothing but the word of God muſt the Church be gouerned: Neither your <hi>Synodical</hi> and <hi>variable diſcipline,</hi> nor your <hi>Elderſhip</hi> is the word of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by your <hi>Synodical diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> or by your <hi>Elderſhips,</hi> the Church may not be gouerned.</p>

But that the hypocriſie of them may better appeare (who here ſpeake againſt Biſhops priſons and ciuill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments) it would be asked of them, what difference (in the ſubſtance of the matter) it is, for an eccleſiaſtical perſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a man to priſon himſelfe, or for their Elderſhips to haue a bedle or Sergeant of the ciuil Magiſtrats attending on their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories euery Court day, who both bringeth thither by force ſuch as will not come being ſent for, and carieth ſuch to priſon as the Elderſhip iudge to deſerue it? as the vſe of <hi>Geneua</hi> is: or to procure gouernours of <hi>Bridewell</hi> to whippe one of their Church that abuſed the Miniſter in ſpeaches (ſitting with his Elderſhip in Conſiſtorie) as not long ſince one of the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was vſed?

As for the difference betweene vs and them, euen ſo great as is betweene obedience and rebellion to God and the Prince: theſe are the men the Biſhops haue diſplaced, let them name their own ſelues: but his meaning is, ſo long as they broch their owne fancies of their Church-gouernment to the people ſeditiouſly, reuile and traduce the perſons of Church-gouernors vniuſtly, inueigh againſt our publike Lyturgie, the lawes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and rites of this Church ragingly, breake all orders, and the precious bond of peace and vnitie ſchiſmatically and wickedly, ſo long they are blameleſſe, and not to be diſplaced. Then turne the caſe the other waies: imagine your <hi>Diſcipline</hi> were vp, and a foote, and I a poore miniſter of that Church, and that I wil not obſerue the order of praying, preaching, miniſtring of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and marrying, preſcribed vnto all miniſters by the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,</hi> (but in ſteede of it) eyther that which I doe nowe vſe, or any other cleane differing deuiſed by my ſelfe: I will likewiſe inueigh againſt the iniuſtice and tyrannie of your Elderſhippes and <hi>Synodes,</hi> and of them who aſſemble there: I will confute that kinde of gouernment which my ſelfe haue ſubſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and condemne it as a tumultuous popularitie, a newe ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans brayne, a multiplied popedome, hauing neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, practiſe, nor commaundement for it: and yet otherwayes (I hope) you ſhall not diſtaine me for life, or vnſound doctrine: ſhal In euertheleſſe bee accounted blameleſſe, and not bee diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

I holde that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape well if I eſcape with baniſhment, and ſo ſaue my life, as I knowe to haue beene practiſed vpon leſſe occaſions then theſe, by your Elderſhippes. You will ſay, you haue good groundes to inueigh againſt ours, and that we may not doe ſo againſt yours, becauſe it is holy, pure, reformed <hi>Diſcipline and proceeding:</hi> then here ought to bee the iſſue, and not to be offended that you are diſplaced as diſturbers of the peace of the Church. For I tell you we thinke no leſſe euill of your gouernment then you ſpeake of ours: <hi>Qui hominem legibus belluam, qui legem hominibus deum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi> 3. <hi>Polit.</hi> And therefore in that all your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is grounded vpon <hi>Law-will-I,</hi> and cheſted vp Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in your Elders breſtes to doe as ſhall like them beſt, we holde it very tyrannie, and as ill as Antichriſtian gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>This is moſt abſurde: for then hee commaunded to be done and ouerdone, that is both done and vndone, viz. both by the Presbyterie, and then by the whole Congregation, for ſo you teache. If in thoſe wordes, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> the Church is the Elderſhip, then the reſt of the Congregation hath not any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to giue conſent or to deale in it, which elſe-where you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. For when the Church that Chriſt committed it vnto, haue once determined the matter, what haue thoſe to doe further that were not meant nor thought of by him? And if hee that tels the Elderſhippe any thing, telles it to the <hi>Church,</hi> what neede any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16243:106"/>moe bee acquainted with that belonges not to them? For if they be of the Church, they knowe it already: <hi>Et qui certus eſt, amplius non debet certiorari:</hi> if they be not, then let them pacifie themſelues: but if the whole Congregation be theremeant, then hath not the Elderſhippe therein authoritie giuen by that place. And if the Church be the Elderſhippe, then the one is the other: <hi>idem numero conuertuntur:</hi> ſo that he that is not of the Elderſhip is none of the Church. To auoide theſe abſurdities, they will ſay the Elderſhippe is called the Church, becauſe it hath herein the authoritie of the Church: This is ſtrange. Shall they bee the Church it ſelfe, that haue herein the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? then he is a king that in ſome thing hath the kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Well let it goe: Thoſe that with vs doe excommunicate haue the Churches authoritie alſo: and let them ſhewe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the worde of God, why the Church may not giue her authoritie to one, aſwell as to many? If this bee one of your eſſentiall pointes, that the Church cannot giue it to one: for ſhame finde ſome Scripture for it. If you ſay that the Church being a collectiue muſt needes bee more then one: true, but yet one or a fewe may haue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of many committed to them, as one man may bee <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic</hi> or <hi>Legate</hi> for a whole common weale. If it cannot bee repreſented but by a number, then two may ſerue: elſe ſhewe by howe many, and both of theſe by Scripture: or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your gouernement not to be grounded on Scripture. And when ſuch authoritie is giuen to many, ſhew that any thing may bee done, except euery of them agree: for if you ſay as you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that the moſt voyces ouercome the fewer: ſhewe Scripture for that, and howe the odde voyce (that makes the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) hath ſuch a power, as to make that to bee the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, which otherwiſe were not ſo. And if in ſuch caſe, one odde voice (perhaps of a very odde fellowe) may haue ſuch force, why may not a Byſhops voyce bee of as great force in this matter, where the Church committes it to him? That by this place the power generall of excommunication is not eſtabliſhed, may thus appeare. For if this be the very warrant and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion that it hath, then may none exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in any other matter then vpon priuate offences originally
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16243:107"/>and onely by the ſame degrees that there bee propounded: otherwiſe the commiſſion were violated. That an Elderſhippe, (as is fancied) ſhoulde haue that power here giuen to them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be entended: for if Chriſt had ordeyned them afore this time, then their authorities whatſoeuer, were (no doubt) giuen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto them: but wee reade no ſuch thing. The pollicie of the Iewiſh Synagogue had ſtill his continuance, and Chriſt had not yet ſetled the Church which hee was in gathering. That by theſe wordes at this time it was erected, it coulde not be: for neither were the officers afore ordeyned of which it conſiſteth, viz. of <hi>Elderly doctor,</hi> and <hi>Paſtor: vndoctorly</hi> and <hi>vnpaſtorally Elder,</hi> and of deacons: nor yet were they here ordeyned.

But Chriſt ſpeaketh hereof to them as of a thing knowen, whereunto in like caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort might bee had. But if it were here appointed conſiſting of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, then was Chriſtes headſhippe of the Church taken from him, and hee ranged with his Apoſtles as his collegues in the Elderſhippe. Then alſo muſt they either ſay that Chriſt was not perpetuall preſident in ſuch elderſhip, but as it fell to his lotte or choiſe (as they now practiſe in Synodes and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, albeit the Paſtor in their Elderſhips be the Preſident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall) or they muſt haue a perpetuall preſident in all their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall aſſemblies to be conformable to this, being the beſt and firſt.

               <p>If therefore to auoyde theſe inconueniences it wilbe ſaid, that he made alluſion to the <hi>Iewiſh Sanhedrim</hi> or College of 72. in vſe with them, and wel knowen to them, with inſinuation, that as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had, ſo hee would haue eſtabliſhed in his Church, which ſhould after be gathered of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Beſides that, it is likely the name of <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> would haue bene retained, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then changed for a name of ſo ſtrange ſignification (as to vnderſtand an Elderſhip by this word <hi>Church</hi>) eſpecially <hi>Christ</hi> hauing before in an other matter vſed the very worde <gap reason="foreign">

That this <hi>Church</hi> here muſt ſo haue, it is manifeſt, in that this place containeth a courſe and proceſſe to be holden with a brother, who ſhall in any matter ſcandalize or offende them. But the moſt offences betwixt man and man growe not vpon matter Eccleſiaſtical, but vpon matters of this life, meere ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cauſes. Then by this reckoning (euen vnder a Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) muſt the Elderſhip haue a ſet Court for all matters aſwel ciuil as Eccleſiaſticall, as the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> did at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> leaſt otherwiſe the woundes be farre greater then the plaiſter can co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But this dealing in ciuill matters they ſeeme to deteſt in others, howſoeuer vnderhand they will embrace it, or diſpenſe with it in themſelues. The <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> were ordinarie Iudges of the higheſt Court of that nation, for all politique temporall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſides Eccleſiaſtical. There were 72. of it, there was no more ſuch in that land, and it conſiſted of the <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> other <hi>Prieſts, Leuites,</hi> and the chiefe and graueſt of the people. If therefore they will conforme theirs vnto this, then are pariſh Elderſhips abroade, and all Courts of Recorde at Weſtminſter ſupped vp at once in this one Conſiſtorie of <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and all Eccleſiaſticall men ſhalbe for euer at libertie to meddle with matters ciuil as in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16243:108"/>their owne right, which were abſurde.

If it be ſaide the two former were corruptions, Firſt I woulde haue it prooued: then I anſwere that <hi>Caluine</hi> maketh the whole <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> it ſelfe but a corruption of that ſtate.
